            Over the years, I've always found the one page smooth scroll
            effect(<a
              href="https://smooth-scroll-snippet-knftwibliv.now.sh/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener"
              >demo</a
            >) aesthetically pleasing and a joy to use when built well i.e not
            janky and responsive to user interaction. In the past, web
            developers have used various plugins and libraries to implement this
            effect and by doing so, they have come across challenges with
            regards to the difficulty of integrating these tools to their code
            base as well as adding extra bloat that could potentially affect the
            performance of their web apps.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of these performance implications it is widely encouraged to
            either search for lightweight alternatives or even leverage on the
            API's and features modern JavaScript provides, making it simpler to
            write the functionality yourself.&nbsp; Previously, writing your own
            logic to effectively produce the smooth scrolling effect was quite
            daunting, to get an idea of what it took, you can
            checkout&nbsp;<span
              >Pete R's implementation or this blog post by&nbsp;Pawel Grzybek
              where he details his process of creating&nbsp;the effect. If you
              don't find the aforementioned code samples intimidating you can
              stop reading this now!&nbsp; But before you do....</span

              effect using one line of code(well, kinda)</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <span
              >Indeed! All you need is
              the&nbsp;<code>Element.scrollIntoView()</code>&nbsp; native
              JavaScript method and you're good to go. Now let's write some
              code!</span

            Implementing such an effect in jquery is quite simple as you can see
